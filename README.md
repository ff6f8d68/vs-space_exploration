**So, you want to create a VS2 addon?**

__Well, here is the template for you!__

This template is a gutted version of 1.18.2 [Eureka](https://github.com/ValkyrienSkies/Eureka)
so some stuff may be left over that you wont necessarily make use of such as publishing to VS Maven

__This template's dependencies include:__
- Architectury API (*its easier than the weird custom services Eureka uses*)
- Valkyrien Skies 2
- VS Core
- Kotlin for Forge
